function [matrixChannel] = matrix_channel(channel)
    % Function:
    %   - calculate the covariance matrix of channel
    %
    % InputArg(s):
    %   - channel [\boldsymbol{h}] (nTxs * nSubbands * nUsers): channel frequency response at each subband
    %
    % OutputArg(s):
    %   - matrixChannel [\boldsymbol{M}] (nUsers * nSubbands) {(nTxs * nSubbands) * (nTxs * nSubbands)}: only keep the iSubband-th block diagonal in the channel covariance matrix and set the others to 0
    %
    % Comment(s):
    %   - the index is above the main diagonal
    %   - each block is of size nTxs * nTxs
